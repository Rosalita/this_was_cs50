1.  stdint.h is a header file that gives access to signed and unsigned integers of various bit sizes
2.  So we know an int will always be the same known size in memory, a set number of bits
3.  A BYTE is 8 bits which is 1 byte, a DWORD is 32 bits which is 4 bytes, a LONG is 32 bits which is 4 bytes, a WORD is 16 bits which is two bytes
4.  The first two bytes will be part of the bitmapfileheader specifically the bfType. This must be BM, in hex these two bytes would be 0x42 and 0x4D
5.  bfsize is the size in bytes of the whole bitmap file while bisize is the size in bytes required by the structure
6.  If biHeight is negative this means that the bitmap is represented in memory from the top down starting in the top left corner
7.  In the bitmapinfo header the field biBitCount specified the colour depth number of bits per pixel
8.  fopen() will return null if it can't complete, for example if it can't find the file it will return null
9.  the third argument to fread() is the number of elements of data to read from the stream. The code is always only reading 1 element
10. 3
11. fseek() sets the file position of the stream to the number of bytes that it is given.
12. SEEK_CUR represents the current position of the file pointer.
